        </em></h5>
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup glutinous white rice (sushi rice)</li>

        <li>1 ½ cups water</li>

        <li>¼ cup rice wine vinegar</li>

        <li> 2 tablespoons white sugar</li>

        <li> ½ teaspoon salt</li>

        <li>1 (1 ounce) package nori (dry seaweed)</li>

        <li>1 medium avocado, thinly sliced</li>

        <li>1 (8 ounce) farmed Atlantic salmon</li>

        <li>3 stalks green onions, halved lengthwise</li>

        <li>¼ cup sriracha mayonnaise (Kikkoman)</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons hoisin sauce</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons black sesame seeds</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon wasabi paste, or to taste</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon pickled ginger, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse rice in a strainer under cold running water until water runs clear. Combine rice and water in a
            saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 20 minutes. Remove
            from heat.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, combine rice wine vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat until sugar
            dissolves. Remove and allow to cool. Stir vinegar mixture into the cooked rice - rice will dry as it cools.
            Allow rice to cool completely, about 30 minutes.</li>

        <li>Place a sheet of nori onto a sushi mat. Place about 1/2 cup rice on top and, using a rice paddle, spread
            rice onto the nori sheet.</li>

        <li>
            Flip nori over so rice is facing down. Arrange 3 to 4 avocado slices, about 2 ounces salmon, 1 strip green
            onion, and 2 teaspoons Sriracha mayonnaise down the middle of the nori sheet.
        </li>

        <li>
            Carefully, but tightly, roll nori up by closing in on the ingredients to form a roll. Drizzle each roll with
            hoisin sauce and more Sriracha mayonnaise and sprinkle with both types of sesame seeds.
        </li>

        <li>Slice each sushi roll into 8 pieces. Serve with a dollop of wasabi and pickled ginger on the side.</li>
    </ol>
